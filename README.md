BlockGrid
=========

**BlockGrid is currently under development and is not ready for use**

BlockGrid is a bukkit world generator, forked from [LRFLEW/SkyGrid](https://github.com/LRFLEW/SkyGrid).
It is based on the original sethbling SkyGrid script.

As with all custom generators, you can use this generator for your default world. Just add the following lines to your bukkit.yml:

    worlds:
      world:
        generator: SkyGrid
        
Or you can use [Multiverse](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Custom-Generator-Plugins).
